#Project Overview
This program will search and give back the ingredients and the price of a product according to its barcode number.

#Program structure
An empty database which will be created to check whether a product is in it or not and add to it if there is no product according to the barcode.
Prompt the user to enter a barcode number and check in the database.
Pull ingredients data from "openfoodfacts" for that product and add to database.
Pull price from an api (to be confirmed) and put in data base.
A gui will show the user back the ingredients and the price of the product in a neat way.
